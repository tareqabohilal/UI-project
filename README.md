​
### Project: Bond-Central
​
### Web-Developers: Adam, Jon, Santiago, Tareq.
​
## 1.What technologies have we implemented?
​
In the realization of this project we structured the pages using HTML5.
​
The styling of the pages were designed through CSS3/SCSS.
​
And finally for the responsiveness of the last "contact" page, a JavaScript function was implemented.
​
## 2.What Techniques have we learned and applied?
​
During this project, we have applied all the knowledge that during the last couple of months we have learned, from basic structure in HTML5 to positioning, keyframes, and CSS-animations, we have learned a bit of JavaScript and how to write a simple function, design a small writer effect, and design a hamburger menu for users of small devices that is activated thanks to the implementation of the Media Queries.
​
### The Media Queries sizes implemented are:
​
- Mobile Devices with a Max-width of 425px.
​
- Tablets with a Min-width of 426px and a Max-width of 768px.
​
- Laptops or any other Mobile devices with a Min-width of 769px and a Max-width of 1024px.
​
- Devices with a Min-width of 1025px.
​
## 3.Main errors and solutions
​
One of the biggest problems we've faced was the creation of the hamburger Menu for small devices as well as the creation of the graveyard area with the writter effect in some of the website pages, that required several proves and errors to fix.
​
Another big issue we've faced was the implementation of JavaScript for the QaA section, that was solve with the guide from our Teacher.
​
## 4.Some good sources we could benefit from?
​
Definitely we got benefits from W3School, CSS-Tricks and Youtube videos with specific topics of our interest.
